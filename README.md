# Human-detection-and-Recognition
By using Histogram Oriented Gradient Algorithm, a human detection system has been built. To recognize individual for detected person, face classifier is also implemented. 


SVM classiﬁer


The ﬁnal step in object recognition using Histogram of Oriented Gradient descriptors is to feed the descriptors into some recognition system based on supervised learning. The Support Vector Machine classiﬁer is a binary classiﬁer which looks for an optimal hyperplane as a decision function. Once trained on images containing some particular object, the SVM classiﬁer can make decisions regarding the presence of an object, such as a human being, in additional test images. In the Dalal and Triggs human recognition tests, they used the freely available SVMLight software package in conjunction with their HOG descriptors to ﬁnd human ﬁgures in test images.
